# TransitPal  |  HackUIowa 23'
## Inspiration
As students going to the University of Minnesota, we have started to use and see the benefits of public transit that we otherwise probably wouldn't have. This has motivated us to create a project that promotes it by way of highlighting its sustainability.
## What it does
Our web app allows you to enter the trips you take on public transit during your everyday life in order to see visual estimates of the positive impact, both environmentally and financial, that choosing public transportation has.
## How we built it
We built our app with Next.js, Firebase, TailwindCSS, and the Google Maps API.
## Challenges we ran into
We faced many challenges while working on this project. One of the problems we ran into was realizing that the API we were depending on lacked the exact information we were looking for. This forced us to think flexibly and adjust to a slightly different core functionality for our app.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As this is all of our's first hackathon, we are definitely proud of the project we created. 
## What we learned
All of us learned a lot about developing with TypeScript and querying data from API's. Also, the experience of working together as a team, from ideation to merging commits, was very valuable for us.
## What's next for TransitPal
There are many feature we wished that we could have implemented but just didn't have time for: optimizing data compilation so that there is less unnecessary work, an alert system to remind the user when to leave for their desired route, saved locations that ease the logging process. These are some of the main features that could be created in the future.
